## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-14

Initial PyPI release. Library was extracted on 2026-05-13 from the
`EdvardGK/ifc-workbench` scratch repo; see [`docs/history/origin.md`](docs/history/origin.md)
for the trail and rename table.

### Added

- `ifcfast.open(path)` — tier-1 parse with lazy data layers (`psets`,
  `quantities`, `materials`, `classifications`, `drift`).
- `ifcfast.header(path)` — tier-0 STEP header read in 30-80 ms regardless
  of file size.
- Parquet cache (`~/.cache/ifcfast/<cache_key>/`) — second open returns
  in tens of milliseconds. Override via `IFCFAST_CACHE` env var.
- `ifcfast.classify` — element-mode policy (count / measure / linear / skip).
- `ifcfast.federated_floors` — multi-discipline floor synthesis with
  project-supplied YAML rules.
- CLI: `ifcfast {index,extract,drift,cache} FILE`.
- Rust binary `ifcfast-mesh` — writes OBJ / glTF / CSV from extrusion,
  mapped, face-set, and BREP representations.
- Pre-built abi3 wheels for Linux (x86_64/aarch64), macOS (x86_64/arm64),
  and Windows (x64) on Python 3.10+.

### Validated

- Byte-level parity vs `ifcopenshell` across 234,144 products from 5
  authoring tools (Tekla, Archicad, Revit IFC4/IFC2X3, MagiCAD, BSProLib).
  See [`docs/history/audit/`](docs/history/audit/).
- 100% parity confirmed on the standalone repo against 4 production
  IFCs from Skiplum projects (issue #1).
- Warm-cache speedup vs `ifcopenshell.open()`: 59-678× on production files.
